Multiply Adjacent Elements in a Tuple

In many data processing tasks, cumulative operations like summation or multiplication of adjacent elements are required. This problem focuses on adjacent element multiplication,
where each pair of consecutive elements in a given tuple is multiplied to generate a new tuple. The input tuple can contain both positive and negative integers, and the goal is to 
compute a resultant tuple where each element is the product of two adjacent elements in the original tuple.

 #
def multiply_adjacent(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i+1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
t = tuple(map(int, input().strip("()").split(", ")))
print(multiply_adjacent(t),end="")
