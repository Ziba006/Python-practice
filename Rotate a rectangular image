Rotate a Rectangular Image by 90 Degrees Clockwise

You are given an image represented by an m x n matrix. Your task is to rotate the image by 90 degrees in the clockwise direction. After rotation, the dimensions of the result matrix will be n x m, as the number of rows and columns will be swapped.

Input Format

Two integers m and n

A matrix of integers of dimension m X n

Output Format

A matrix of integers of dimension n X m

#
def rotate_matrix(m, n, matrix):
    # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
    transposed = [[matrix[i][j] for i in range(m)] for j in range(n)]
    
    # Step 2: Reverse each row
    for row in transposed:
        row.reverse()
    
    return transposed

# Input
m, n = map(int, input().split())
matrix = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Rotate the matrix
result = rotate_matrix(m, n, matrix)

# Output the rotated matrix
for row in result:
    print(" ".join(map(str, row)))
