Sorting the Royal Manuscripts

You are an apprentice in the Royal Library of the Vijayanagara Empire, home to centuries-old ancient manuscripts filled with knowledge on astronomy, Ayurveda, and warfare. However, a strong monsoon wind has scattered the manuscripts in random order!

The Rajguru (Royal Scholar) assigns you a crucial task: sort the manuscripts using the ancient "Bubble Sort" technique. But thereâ€™s a ruleâ€”you must record the order of manuscripts after every pass, as the Rajguru wishes to witness the sorting magic unfold gradually.

Your sorting spell, called "Grantha Sudharaka" (Sacred Manuscript Arranger), can swap two manuscripts at a time, ensuring the heaviest ones settle at the bottom after each pass. Your goal is to restore order to the library as quickly as possible. If there are no swaps, you can stop the process of arranging.

Can you help bring back order to the Royal Library of Vijayanagara?
