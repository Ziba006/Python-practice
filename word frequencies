The Mystery of Word Frequencies

You are tasked with analyzing a mysterious message that was intercepted. The message seems to contain a series of repeated words, and the challenge is to count how many times each word appears. To solve this, you must write a Python program that takes a string of text and counts the frequency of each word.

Make sure your program is case-insensitive, as the secret message is a mix of upper and lower case letters.

After counting the occurrences of each word, display the results.


Input Format:  A line of text

Output format: For all the unique words in the sentence, word: followed by frequency.

from collections import Counter

def count_word_frequencies(text):
    words = text.lower().split()
    word_count = Counter(words)
    for word, count in word_count.items():
        print(f"{word}: {count}")
input_text = input("")
count_word_frequencies(input_text)
